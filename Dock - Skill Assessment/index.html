					<h3 style="text-align: center; line-height: 25px">CFP Board Launches Video Series and Handbook to Explain 
						<br>CFP Board’s Enforcement and Adjudication Process
					</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 23px; padding: 5px 0 15px;"><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C., January 30, 2024 </strong>– CFP Board today announced it has produced the <a href="https://www.cfp.net/ethics/enforcement/upholding-the-code-and-standards">Upholding the Code &amp; Standards video series</a> and an associated <a href="https://www.cfp.net/-/media/files/cfp-board/standards-and-ethics2023-handbook-for-respondents.pdf">Handbook for Respondents</a> to educate CFP&#174; professionals and the public about CFP Board’s enforcement and adjudication process. CFP Board is committed to setting and upholding ethical standards that benefit the public. The steps CFP Board has taken to uphold its <a href="https://www.cfp.net/ethics/code-of-ethics-and-standards-of-conduct">Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct (Code and Standards)</a> distinguish CFP&#174; certification from other credentials in the financial services profession.</p>
					
					<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 23px; padding: 5px 0 15px;">“CFP Board aims to uphold standards in a manner that is fair to those whose conduct is being evaluated and credible to the public,” said <a href="https://www.cfp.net/about-cfp-board/leadership-and-staff/kevin-r-keller">CFP Board CEO Kevin R. Keller, CAE</a> “These new resources are designed to educate CFP&#174; professionals and the public, foster confidence in our processes, support ongoing professional development and maintain the integrity of CFP&#174; certification.” </p>

					<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 23px; padding: 5px 0 15px;">The <a href="https://www.cfp.net/ethics/enforcement/upholding-the-code-and-standards">Upholding the Code &amp; Standards video series</a> is composed of nine short, animated videos. Two videos are intended primarily for the public: one that provides an overview of the enforcement process and another that explains how CFP Board addresses concerns from the public regarding professional conduct. The handbook and the remaining seven videos are most relevant to Respondents in a CFP Board proceeding. </p>

					<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 23px; padding: 5px 0 15px;">The video titles and brief descriptions of each are as follows:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> <strong><u>Video 1: Enforcement Process Overview</u></strong><br>
								CFP Board’s Procedural Rules set forth Enforcement and Adjudication processes that are credible to the public and fair to those whose conduct is being evaluated.

							</li>
								<li><strong><u>Video 2: Introduction to Investigations</u></strong><br>
									This video explains how CFP Board detects information leading to an investigation, what to do if you receive a Notice of Investigation, and how to respond.
								</li>
							<li> <strong><u>Video 3: Duty of Cooperation</u></strong><br>This video describes a CFP&#174; professional’s Duty of Cooperation and discusses the consequences of failing to cooperate with CFP Board’s investigation.
								</li>
							<li> <strong><u>Video 4: Resolution of the Investigation Process
								</u></strong><br>This video explains how CFP Board resolves an investigation, covering topics such as dismissal and the initial process of filing a complaint alleging a violation of the Code and Standards.</li>
							<li><strong><u>Video 5: Settlements, Complaints and Motions
								</u></strong><br>This video describes CFP Board’s peer-review process for determining whether a CFP&#174; professional has violated CFP Board’s Code and Standards.
							</li>
								<li><strong><u>Video 6: Hearing Process, DEC Decisions &amp; Appeals
								</u></strong><br>This video describes hearings before CFP Board’s Disciplinary and Ethics Commission (DEC), decisions issued by the DEC and CFP Board’s appeals process.
								</li>
								<li><strong><u>Video 7: Interim Suspensions &amp; Administrative Orders
								</u></strong><br>This video describes CFP Board’s process for handling special cases, including cases involving conduct requiring emergency action and cases involving a Respondent’s failure to cooperate with CFP Board’s investigation or disciplinary process.
							</li>
								<li><strong><u>Video 8: Post-Hearing Compliance &amp; Reinstatement
								</u></strong><br>This video describes the obligations of a Respondent after they have been subject to sanctions under the Procedural Rules.
								</li>
								<li><strong><u>Video 9: The Grievance Process
								</u></strong><br>This video describes the process for lodging a complaint with CFP Board.
